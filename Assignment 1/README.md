# Assignment 1

## Part 1 (echo.py)

To simulate a real world echo, the code in echo.py uses a loop to print out substrings of decreasing length that is dependent on the amount of repetitions that are desired (default is 3). Screenshots of the code and sample outputs are provided below. [Please click here to view the source code](https://github.com/dasorensen/CS3980/blob/main/Assignment%201/echo.py)
