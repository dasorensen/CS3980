# Assignment 3

The objective of this assignment was to become familiar with MongoDB Compass and to successfully run a couple of queries on the sample_mflix database.

## Query 1
The first query that was requested was to find all movies with a runtime greater than 200 minutes from the year 1983. The results should be sorted by increasing runtime and should 
only include the relevant information (title, runtime, and year). The query entry and results are shown in the screenshot below.

## Query 2
The second query involved finding all movies after the year 2014 that have an IMDB rating greater than 9. There were no sorting requirements for this query, but again I have 
only included the relevent information. My entry and the given results are shown below.
